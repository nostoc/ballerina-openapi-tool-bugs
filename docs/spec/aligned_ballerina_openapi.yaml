        Upload a file that can be used across various endpoints. Individual files can be up to 512 MB, and the size of all files uploaded by one organization can be up to 100 GB.

        The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for details.

        The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has certain required formats for fine-tuning [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.

        The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input also has a specific required [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).

        Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these storage limits.

        Creates an intermediate [Upload](/docs/api-reference/uploads/object) object that you can add [Parts](/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-object) to. Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an hour after you create it.

        Once you complete the Upload, we will create a [File](/docs/api-reference/files/object) object that contains all the parts you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular File object.

        For certain `purpose`s, the correct `mime_type` must be specified. Please refer to documentation for the supported MIME types for your use case:
        - [Assistants](/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files)

        For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please follow the documentation on [creating a File](/docs/api-reference/files/create).

        Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length

            Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

            **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length

You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated

    AssistantStreamEvent:
      description: |
        Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

        Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

        ```
        event: thread.created
        data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
        integrate the Assistants API with streaming

            If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation

      You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createThreadAndRun),
      [Create Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs)
      endpoints by passing `"stream": true`. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream.
      Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the

    description: |
      The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

      While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.
